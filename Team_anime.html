                with our university together with Sander. In the lab, Tim is part of the Cloning team of our lab squad and he is also
                part of acquisition. 70% of the time we know where he is and we can see him. The other 30%? Try looking in the

                other teams? Via Mick, the Collaboration Captain. This guy really has it all (except for a strong knee).

              <p class="disappear">Luc (Lucas) Brunsveld (1975) received his PhD degree in 2001 under supervision of prof. Bert Meijer at the Eindhoven
                University of Technology. Topic of the thesis was the self-assembly of designed molecules into helical architectures
                in water. Subsequently, he moved as a Humboldt fellow to the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Physiologie, Dortmund,
                to work on the protein semi-synthesis and evaluation of lipidated Ras GTPases in the group of prof. Herbert Waldmann.
                From 2003-2004 he worked as a group leader in the medicinal chemistry department of Organon (now Schering-Plough) in
                Oss, on nuclear receptor medicinal chemistry.
                <br>
                End of 2004 Luc Brunsveld received the Sofja Kovalevskaja Award from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, with
                which he established his own research group at the MPI of Molecular Physiologie, Dortmund, beginning 2005. He worked
                on the combination of supramolecular chemistry with protein biochemistry and cellular biology, generating new
                approaches to modulate biological processes. In 2006 he became group leader at the Chemical Genomics Centre of the
                Max Planck Society, Dortmund. Here he was working on the chemical biology of nuclear receptors to understand and
                modulate the nuclear receptor-cofactor interaction, in close collaboration with Bayer-Schering Pharma, Merck-Serono,
                and Schering-Plough. In the middle of 2008 Luc Brunsveld received an ERC starting grant and became full professor in
                chemical biology in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology. In his
                research Luc Brunsveld uses chemical biology approaches to study protein-protein interactions. Two general themes
                are: 1) Supramolecular Architectures are being pursued as instruments to modulate protein-protein interactions and
                2) the Nuclear Receptor – Cofactor interaction is being investigated as a specific protein-protein interaction with
                many unsolved questions, possibly amendable via chemical biology.

                (1995, cum laude). He did his PhD with Prof. Averill (1999, University of Amsterdam) working on purple
                acid phosphatases, and was an HSFP post-doctoral fellow with Prof. Lippard (MIT, 1999-2001). Currently
                he is a professor in protein engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology and a core member
                of the Institute for Complex Molecular Systems (ICMS). His group combines approaches from protein
                engineering, chemical biology, and synthetic biology to develop biomolecular sensors and actuators
                for applications in intracellular imaging, point-of-care diagnostics, optogenetics, and
                antibody-based therapies. An important research theme is the engineering of biomolecular switches,
                which include fluorescent and bioluminescent sensor proteins for intracellular imaging,
                photo-switchable proteins, and protein- and DNA-based sensors for antibody detection and actuation.
                He obtained young investigator grants from NWO (VIDI, 2006) and an ERC consolidator grant in 2011.
                In 2012 he received the award for the best TU/e teacher at the master's level.. Prof. Merkx has

                (Harvard) working on protein affinity screening using droplet microfluidics. Current research themes are
                centered on the engineering of artificial cellular systems (bottom-up synthetic biology) with the aim to
