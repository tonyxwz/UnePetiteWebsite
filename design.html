                <h1 style="text-align: center;">Design</h1>
                <p>The aim of the project of iGEM Eindhoven is to create a living material: a new type of hybrid
                  material with integrated living organisms. Using the power of synthetic biology, the genetic
                  network of these organisms can be programmed to yield smart, responsive and adaptive materials
                  capable of performing advanced functions. Our organism of choice for such a material is <em>E. coli</em>,
                  the workhorse of synthetic biology. In designing and realizing such a complex material and
                  demonstrating its potential, we adhered to the following universal engineering principles:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Modularity</b>: Our design must consist out of separate parts which we individually
                    characterize and optimize before integrating them into a proof-of-principle</li>
                  <li><b>Reproducibility</b>: Our design must yield reproducible results & behaviour in our experiments</li>
                  <li><b>Prototyping</b>: To test the performance of our design, we create prototypes which we can rapidly test to adapt our design</li>
                  <li><b>Safe-by-Design</b>: During the design process, we consider safety in an integrative way right from
                    the start. Please also see our <a href="http://2018.igem.org/Team:TU-Eindhoven/Human_Practices#ethics-container">Safe-by-Design page</a> for more information on how we implemented
                    this engineering principle during our project.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>No concept is convincing without a concrete application scenario. Therefore, we divided ourselves
                  in two groups, one group working on the living material itself and one working on the application
                  scenario necessary to illustrate the potential of living materials to the general public.</p>

                    <h2>Living Materials as Platform for New Technological Innovations</h2>
                    <p>The fundamental problems impeding the successful realisation of living materials are the demanding requirements for an environment in which living organisms can be maintained in a viable, functional way and biosafety concerns of the escape of genetically modified organisms into the environment <a href="#designref1">(1)</a>. This lead us to establish design requirements, preferences and constraints that apply to our living material. These are general concepts, as the living material we propose can be used for many different applications. For each application, other specific criteria apply as can be seen in our application scenario of a living material as a patch for burns and chronic wounds (see below).</p>
                    <p>
                      <ul><b>Requirements:</b>
                        <li>Modularity: The living material must be capable of performing different functions by integrating genetically engineered <em>E. coli</em> with different functionalities.</li>
                        <li>(Bio)safety: The living material must be designed in such a way that bacterial escape from the material is prevented and the material is safe to use.</li>
                        <li>Viability: The living material must be a permissive environment for <em>E. coli</em>, allowing their survival and functioning in the material for a prolonged period.</li>
                        <li>Robustness: The living material must have appropriate mechanical properties to yield a living device that can perform in the desired situation.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <ul><b>Preferences:</b>
                        <li>Affordability: The production and maintenance of the living material is not too expensive for the application.</li>
                        <li>Ease of manufacturing & scalability: To allow widespread use of this new technological innovation, production should be straightforward and allow for upscaling of the manufacturing procedure to industrial scale.</li>
                        <li>Sustainable: The living material and its production process must be environmentally-friendly.</li>
                        <li>User friendliness: The material should be easy to use by the targeted user for a certain application.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <ul><b>Constraints:</b>
                        <li>We have to use <em>E. coli</em> as living organism in our material as we were limited to bacteria available at our university.</li>
                      </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>Our material of choice for a living material is a hydrogel, a polymer network with water
                      as dispersion medium. Hydrogels are inherently biocompatible, permeable and have a high
                      water content. This makes them an ideal matrix for living materials <a href="#designref1">(1)</a>. Their use as cell
                      delivery vehicles <a href="#designref2">(2)</a> and scaffolds for tissue engineering <a href="#designref2">(3)</a> proves their suitability
                      as viable environment for living cells and organisms. We quickly realized that our
                      hydrogel has conflicting demands. It should prevent bacterial escape but also have an
                      open porous structure to allow a viable environment with free diffusion of oxygen,
                      nutrients, signalling molecules and proteins. Simple physical entrapment of the bacteria
                      does therefore not suffice. We envisioned that the solution to this conflict is to
                      actively tether <em>E. coli</em> tightly to our material. In this way, we prevent the diffusion
                      of <em>E. coli</em> out of our gel while allowing the free transport of solutes. Our
                      hydrogel-anchor combination should thus act as a sort of prison, keeping the <em>E. coli</em>
                      bacteria alive and happy, but restricting their movement. The concept of <em>Gelcatraz</em> was
                      born.

                    <h3>Adhesin</h3>
                    <p>The first step to realizing <em>Gelcatraz</em> started with the identification of a suitable bacterial
                      adhesin to anchor the <em>E. coli</em> bacteria to the hydrogel. Recently, a large 1.5 MDa <a class="tooltipsBtn" data-target="adhesinTooltip" onclick="showTooltips(event);">adhesin</a> was
                      found in the Antarctic bacterium <em>Marinomonas primoryensis</em>. This large adhesin, named
                      <em>M. primoryensis</em> ice-binding protein (<em>Mp</em>IBP), is 0.6 µm long and consists of more than 130
                      domains. Its structure is shown on the right, click here  for background information about the
                      adhesin. 120 of these domains encode for the same immunoglobin-like β-sandwich that rigidifies
                      upon binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and acts as an extender to project the binding domains positioned on top
                      of this extender chain into the medium <a href="#designref4">(4)</a>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      In our design process, we envisioned that
                      we could use the sugar binding domain of <em>Mp</em>IBP, from which we created a new basic
                      part , to bind to a sugar-based polymer. On the other parts of the wiki, we will
                      refer to the shortened version of <em>Mp</em>IBP combined with the sugar binding domain as
                      ‘adhesin’ . In this way, we can tether the <em>E. coli</em> bacteria to our hydrogel.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      In its native host, the <em>Mp</em>IBP adhesin is exported out of the cell using the single-step
                      type I secretion machinery.  The type I secretion of the adhesin requires four protein
                      domains. Hemolysin A (HlyA) is a protein domain C-terminal to the adhesin protein,
                      signalling for type I secretion. Hemolysin B (HlyB), Hemolysin D (HlyD) and TolC are
                      the other proteins which are responsible for forming a trans-periplasmic export channel
                      upon interaction with the HlyA domain, as shown in the figure. In type I secretion, all
                      proteins passing the conserved the β-barrel pore of TolC, must remain unfolded. The RIM
                      and RIN domains of the adhesin (see <a href="#adhesinStructure">Figure. 1</a>) are the only domains that fold
                      'independent of calcium. Calcium is naturally present in millimolar concentrations in
                      sea water, the natural environment of <em>M. primoryensis</em>. The entire adhesin is translocated
                      to the extracellular space where the domains fold, but the RIM and RIN domain are already
                      folded and prevent translocation through the TolC protein. The RIM protein fits inside the
                      TolC pore, with the RIN being a bulky anchor preventing total release of the adhesin.
                      The RIM & RIN domain act as a TolC β-barrel plug <a href="#designref4">(4)</a>. In our design, we want to use this
                      ingenious system to express the adhesin on the surface of <em>E. coli</em>. However, the native
                      adhesin is too large to be produced in <em>E. coli</em>. To avoid problems with expressing the
                      adhesin in <em>E. coli</em>, we reduced the amount of RII repeats in the gene encoding the adhesin to fifteen.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Plasmid design</h4>
                    <p>As we adhere to the engineering principle of modularity, we want all our individual components
                      of our project to be able to be altered or optimized separately. Therefore, we cloned the
                      shortened MpIBP adhesin into a PET24 vector (kanamycin resistance) under control of a T7 promotor
                      inducible by adding isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). TolC is already constitutively
                      expressed in <em>E. coli</em> <a href="#designref6">(6)</a>. To enable expression of HlyB and HlyD, both proteins were cloned into a
                      pSTV28 vector (chloramphenicol resistance) under control of of a lac promotor inducible with IPTG.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Hydrogel</h3>
                    <p>To find an appropriate hydrogel for our adhesin to bind to, we used the fact that this
                      sugar binding domain has its highest affinity for glucose <a href="#designref7">(7)</a>. In our design of a living
                      material platform, the following requirements were established to find a gel:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                      <li>The hydrogel must be <b>biocompatible</b> (non-toxic to <em>E. coli</em>).</li>
                      <li>The hydrogel must have an open <b>porous</b> structure for efficient and fast nutrient,
                        oxygen and solute exchange for survival and functioning of the <em>E. coli</em> bacteria.</li>
                      <li>The hydrogel must be <b>mechanically stable</b> to prevent bacterial leakage and to be easy to handle.</li>
                      <li>The hydrogel must <b>not degrade</b> for a sustained period of time.</li>
                      <li>The hydrogel <b>synthesis</b> must be relatively <b>straightforward and reproducible</b>.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Dextran is a polymer that consists of α-1,6-linked D-glucopyranose (glucose) residues.
                      This glucose-based nature makes dextran an ideal polymer for our <em>Mp</em>IBP adhesin to bind to.
                      The polymer is non-toxic and has been investigated for tissue engineering applications and
                      is already used in the clinic as blood plasma substitutes <a href="#designref8">(8)</a>. A hydrogel from dextran
                      polymer chains can be synthesized using radical polymerisation of glycidyl methacrylated
                      dextran <a href="#designref9">(9)</a>. By adapting their protocol, we designed a supermacroporous dextran hydrogel
                      with pores ranging from 1 to 100 micrometer that suits our needs. This unique morphology
                      allows for the rapid and non-restricted mass-transport of solutes of virtually any size <a href="#designref9">(9)</a>.
                      Combining all elements described above, we envision our living material to be as shown in the figure below:
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Testing Our Living Material Platform</h3>
                    <p>To demonstrate the performance and behaviour of our designed living material platform,
                      we designed and carried out multiple experiments of which a more detailed analysis of the
                      results can be seen <a href="http://2018.igem.org/Team:TU-Eindhoven/Results">here</a>.
                      <a href="TODO:Link to SEM hydrogel">Scanning Electron Microscopy experiments</a> were performed to find
                      the optimal hydrogel polymerisation conditions to produce the desired microporous structure.
                      When this yielded mechanically unstable hydrogels, shaking experiments with different
                      hydrogel synthesis conditions were performed to find the appropriate conditions for stable
                      hydrogels.
                    </p>
                    <p>For the adhesin, we first investigated the dextran binding capability of the isolated
                      MpIBP sugar binding domain. In this experiment, the MpIBP sugar binding domain is incubated
                      with dextran beads and washed, after which we could show that the protein remains bound to
                      dextran using SDS-Page  and that binding occurs in a calcium-dependent fashion. Next, we used
                      <a href="TODO:link to FACS">Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS)</a> and flow cytometry experiments to investigate the binding of red
                      fluorescent <em>E. coli</em> bacteria expressing the <em>Mp</em>IBP adhesin to dextran beads and could confirm
                      binding of the adhesin to dextran.
                    </p>

                    <p>Integrating both the adhesin and hydrogel together as a complete platform, a hydrogel cell
                        seeding and washing experiment was devised using small gels casts in 96-well plates. After
                        overnight seeding of the gels, washing and subsequent crushing of the gel was used. Plating
                        these fractions, we could demonstrate that the adhesin causes a three-to-four fold higher
                        retention of bacteria inside the hydrogel.
                    </p>

                    <p>Unfortunately, we came to the realization that seeding our gels this way resulted in very
                      inconsistent and difficult to reproduce results. That is, the results where difficult to
                      standardize or accurately quantify. This goes against multiple of our formulated engineering
                      principles and requirements for the living material platform. We therefore had to completely
                      redesign both our hydrogel and the seeding process. Using Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)
                      microfabrication, we designed a cubic mold in which a plastic pin can be inserted. When we cast the
                      hydrogel in this mold, we create a hydrogel with a chamber in the center. This chamber can be loaded
                      with bacteria to seed the hydrogel. After seeding, a plastic plunger can be used to close the gel. With
                      this reinvented prototype, <a href="TODO:Hyperlink to results of adhesin">seeding experiments</a>
                      yielded more consistent results, observing a difference in retention of several orders of magnitude
                      betweenbacteria with and without adhesin.</p>

                    <h2>Fighting against Infections of Burns and Chronic Wounds</h2>
                    <p>As a team, we felt that convincing the public about the potential of living materials
                      is difficult without a clear, concrete and appealing application scenario. To illustrate
                      the potential of living materials, we decided to develop it into a living skin patch
                      capable of the continuous secretion of bacteriocins to combat bacteria responsible for
                      infections in patients suffering from burns and chronic wounds. For a detailed analysis
                      of the background of the problem and our interviews with experts and stakeholders please
                      see our <a href="http://2018.igem.org/Team:TU-Eindhoven/Human_Practices">Human Practices</a> section
                      and <a href="http://2018.igem.org/Team:TU-Eindhoven/Applied_Design">Applied Design</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>As mentioned above, this specific application scenario leads to additional requirements,
                      preferences and constraints. As a team we formulated the following:
                    </p>

                    <ul><b>Requirements:</b>
                      <li>Safety & Biocompatibility: The bacteriocin secreting patch should be safe to use for patients  and for healthcare professionals and should be easy to sterilize before seeding with bacteria to avoid the introduction of other bacteria near the wound.</li>
                      <li>Effectivity: The effect of the patch should be limited to offending bacteria, with <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> as our primary target</li>
                      <li>User friendliness: The patch must be easy to use for healthcare professionals such as doctors and nurses. It must also be comfortable for patients. In contrast to the living material, user friendliness is for wound healing no longer a preference, but a requirement.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul><b>Preferences:</b>
                      <li>Modularity: Ideally our patch can target different bacterial strains by simply changing the bacteriocin encoding gene.</li>
                      <li>Longevity: Our patch should be able to perform its function for a prolonged period, maximizing the use of continuous secretion and limiting the amount of patch changes patients experience.</li>
                      <li>Storability: The patch must have a suitable shelf-life and should be straightforward to store to compete with already existing
                          treatments and to avoid availability issues.</li>
                      <li>Approval: The base material of the patch (the hydrogel) should ideally be already approved by the U.S. Food and
                          Drug Administration (FDA) and  European Medicines Agency such that only the integration of living organisms requires
                          investigation and approval by regulatory institutions to accelerate implementation.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul><b>Constraints:</b>
                      <li>The bacteriocins secreted by the patch must not be toxic to <em>E. coli</em> and must only be active against
                          the specific strains of bacteria causing problems.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Our living dextran hydrogel is very suitable for wound healing. Our hydrogel is stable at
                        physiological conditions for months and can be stored in a dried state and re-swollen prior
                        to use, avoiding availability problems <a href="#designref8">(9)</a>. Dextran is already approved by the FDA for
                        clinical use for plasma volume expansion, antithrombotic agent and peripheral flow promotion
                        <a href="#designref9">(10)</a>. Furthermore, the hydrogel can be easily sterilized using radiation
                        <a href="#designref10">(11)</a>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To target <em>S. aureus</em>, we used lysostaphin, a zinc endopeptidase that cleaves the pentaglycine
                        cross-bridges present in the bacterial cell wall of <em>S. aureus</em>. Lysostaphin exhibits its
                        lytic effect not only against regular <em>S. aureus</em>, but also against methicillin-resistant
                        <em>S. aureus</em> (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em> and <em>S. epidermidis</em>. Recently, it was
                        demonstrated that hydrogels delivering lysostaphin outperform prophylactic antibiotic
                        treatment and soluble lysostaphin treatment in murine femur fracture models <a href="#designref12">(12)</a>. The
                        iGEM teams <a href="http://2012.igem.org/Team:HIT-Harbin">HIT-Harbin 2012</a> and <a href="http://2016.igem.org/Team:Stockholm">Stockholm 2016</a> have used lysostaphin before in their
                        projects to target <em>S. aureus</em>. However, both teams relied on cell lysis to free the
                        lysostaphin. For our application, this approach is useless as releasing bacterial cell
                        lysate into the wound will only act as food for the offending bacteria causing the infection.
                        Moreover, cell lysis does not offer a solution for sustained release of lysostaphin. The
                        solution to this problem is to make lysostaphin secretable. This will allow sustained release
                        of the active enzyme and ensures that the lysostaphin reaching the wound is of high purity.
                    </p>
                    <p>To minimize the burden on our modified <em>E. coli</em> bacteria already expressing the MpIBP adhesin,
                        we make use of the same type I secretion system. This can be achieved by fusing the HlyA
                        domain C-terminal to the lysostaphin construct. To optimize expression, we first codon
                        optimized the  <a href="http://2012.igem.org/Team:HIT-Harbin">HIT-Harbin 2012</a> truncated lysostaphin construct . Fusion to HlyA will
                        enable secretion, circumventing the use of cell lysis, improving the biokiller device
                        developed by  <a href="http://2012.igem.org/Team:HIT-Harbin">HIT-Harbin 2012</a> . With other
                        iGEM projects in mind, <a href="">we chose a thrombin linker to fuse HlyA to lysostaphin</a>
                        as it can be readily cleaved with the thrombin enzyme
                        and added a His tag to the HlyA domain for protein detection and purification purposes.
                        If all systems work as designed, culturing of induced <em>E. coli</em> transfected with our designed
                        construct and the HlyB/HlyD secretion proteins results in medium filled with our
                        lysostaphin-HlyA fusion protein. Running the medium over a nickel affinity column isolates
                        the fusion protein and the thrombin linker can be cleaved with the thrombin enzyme,
                        resulting in pure truncated lysostaphin without the HlyA domain. Purification of a recombinantly
                        expressed protein from a medium sample has important advantages over intracellular expression
                        followed by cell lysis and purification from the lysate. The need of cell lysis is eliminated,
                        aggregation in inclusion bodies in the cytosol is prevented, toxic effect of overexpressed
                        proteins are reduced and downstream purification and processing steps are reduced significantly.
                        <a href="#designref13">(13)</a> Our construct can benefit future teams by making purification of lysostaphin straightforward.
                        For example, <a href="http://2016.igem.org/Team:Stockholm">Stockholm 2016</a> intended to functionalize spider silk with lysostaphin
                        but did not manage to successfully purify lysostaphin.
                       We also created <a href="TODO:link to T7-lyso-Hlya"> a different lysostaphin construct</a> already containing an IPTG inducible T7 promotor allowing other teams to start right away.</a>
                    </p>
                    <h4>Plasmid design</h4>
                    <p>To adhere to the engineering principle of modularity, the lysostaphin component has to be able to be controlled
                        individually. Therefore, we cloned our lysostaphin-HlyA fusion protein into a pBAD vector, under the control
                        of an AraC promotor inducible with arabinose.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Adapting Our Patch Design</h3>
                    <p>
                        After several <a href="http://2018.igem.org/Team:TU-Eindhoven/Human_Practices">conversations with experts</a> on the topic of burn and chronic wounds, we
                        found out that besides <em>S. aureus</em>, <em>P. aeruginosa</em>is also a major cause of problems in
                        wound care of patients with burns and chronic wounds. As our lysostaphin-HlyA has a
                        modular design, we changed the coding sequence of lysostaphin to that of
                        <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2812007">pyocin S5</a>generating a new BioBrick in addition to lysostaphin. Pyocin S5 is a bacteriocin
                        active against <em>P. aeruginosa</em><a href="#designref13">(14)</a>, enabling our patch to combat both simultaneously.
                        With the conversations we had with experts, we also learned about the importance of
                        a kill switch besides our adhesin to neutralize the danger posed to the environment
                        if bacteria would be able to escape despite our adhesin. Therefore, we also worked
                        on this in our design. Please see our <a href="http://2018.igem.org/Team:TU-Eindhoven/Applied_Design">Applied Design</a> section for the kill switch
                        and for an analysis of the potential impact of our bacteriocin secreting patch.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Putting Our Patch to the Test</h3>
                    <p>To test the design of our bacteriocin secreting patch, we <a href="TODO:Link to pellet expression experiments">first</a> carried
                        out protein expression experiments to show that our modified <em>E. coli</em> can express the lysostaphin. Next, we
                        co-transformed our pBAD-lysostaphin part with the HlyB/D secretion system and showed that secretion of lysostaphin
                        <a href="TODO:link to western blot">works</a> . To prove the functionality of our construct, multiple experiments
                        were carried out in collaboration with the PAMM foundation. We designed the experiments, but PAMM carried them out
                        for us as we were not allowed to work with <em>S. aureus</em> due to biosafety regulations. The PAMM foundation is
                        the regional center for infectious diseases and pathology of South East Brabant, the Netherlands. The experimental
                        plan of showing the functionality of the patch is as follows:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Show that lysate of our induced genetically modified <em>E. coli</em> is toxic against <em>S. aureus</em>, but not against <em>Streptococcus</em>agalactiae (a gram positive bacterial train used as negative control) by pipetting cell lysate onto <em>Streptococcus</em>culture and show that uninduced <em>E. coli</em> is not toxic.</li>
                            <li>Show that medium (purified, no more antibiotic present) of our induced genetically modified <em>E. coli</em> is toxic to <em>S. aureus</em>, but not against <em>Streptococcus agalactiae</em> and show that uninduced secretion or secretion of only HlyA is not toxic against <em>S. aureus</em> to prove secretion of our construct.</li>
                            <li>Show that a co-culture of our induced genetically modified <em>E. coli</em> is toxic against <em>S. aureus</em>, but not against <em>Streptococcus</em>agalactiae and show that a co-culture of uninduced modified <em>E. coli</em> lacks this toxic effect to demonstrate our <em>E. coli</em> results in the lytic effect and that this effect is not due to something else present in the medium (e.g. remnants of antibiotics).</li>
                            <li>Show that purified medium of our induced genetically modified <em>E. coli</em> loaded into the hydrogel cube with chamber kills <em>S. aureus</em> to show that diffusion of lysostaphin through the gel works.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>We were able to perform all the experiments described above successfully and could demonstrate the
                        functionality of our lysostaphin-HlyA construct and the diffusion through the gel. For the results
                        of the experiments in collaboration with PAMM, please click <a href="TODO:insert link to pamm result">here</a>.
                        For Pyocin S5, we envisioned a similar strategy but were not able to complete it within time.
                    </p>
                    <p>The last experiment is a complete proof-of-principle: Combining both the adhesin component of our living
                        material platform to retain the <em>E. coli</em> bacteria inside the hydrogel continuously secreting lysostaphin
                        to combat <em>S. aureus</em>. Unfortunately, we did not have time to finish this experiment.

                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <p>Looking back at the initial goals of our project, we can conclude that we managed to develop a hydrogel with suitable
                        mechanical and chemical stability with the right supermacroporous microstructure for our envisioned application. The
                        effect of the adhesin to entrap the <em>E. coli</em> in our hydrogel and both the secretion and effectivity of our designed
                        lysostaphin construct has been successfully demonstrated. All individual components of our living bacteriocin
                        secreting patch work as intended. Therefore, we are convinced that the integrated wound healing patch will function
                        as expected.
                    </p>

                    <p>After finishing our project, we can review our engineering principles formulated before we started the design of our
                        project. We achieved modularity by using unique promotors and vectors for each component to allow individual
                        manipulation to optimize the integrated system. We used prototyping to generate different shapes and sizes of our
                        hydrogel and used PDMS microfabrication to improve our design of the hydrogel. By performing all experiments at
                        least in duplo and repeating them multiple times we ensured the reproducibility of our results. Via integration
                        of our conversations we had with experts for Human Practice and Applied Design parts of our project, we implemented
                        safety as a key feature in our design.

                    <p>In nature, the function of <em>Mp</em>IBP is multifaceted. With its ice-binding domain, it positions 
                        the <em>M. primoryensis</em> on top of the water column where there is still sunlight.
                        With its peptide and sugar binding domain, it binds to other M. primoryensis bacteria,
                        making a strong multivalent connection with ice to resist fluid fow, but it also binds
                        to diatoms with these domains. These photosynthethic microalgae produce oxygen and waste
                        products that feed the strictly aerobic M. primoryenisis. MpIBP plays a crucial role in
                        forming a symbiotic microbial biofilm under the ice. <a href="#designref4">(4)</a>
