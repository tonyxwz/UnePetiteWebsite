            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>From the beginning, the Human Practices took a central role in shaping our
                project. When we started our brainstorm sessions in March, we had no clue which
                topic we wanted to explore. Yet, we wanted it to be relevant to society.
                During these first months, we got the opportunity to interact with experts
                and the public to discuss our ideas. These encounters were of great help in
                our topic selection. During a visit to the Dutch Institute for Public Health
                and the Environment (RIVM) and the Rathenau Instituut (Dutch organization for
                technology assessment), we realized that the lack of a safe platform for
                working with GMOs outside of controlled environments is a problem on itself
                that deserves a solution. We were excited to tackle this issue with
                Gelcatraz, but also wanted to work towards a more concrete application. In
                the time that followed, we consulted several experts and interacted with the
                public to get feedback on our proposals. Once we had settled on the wound
                healing application, we interacted with more stakeholders and experts to
                shape the design of the wound healing patch. We realize that our project
                would not have been the same without the Human Practices. In the following
                section, we share the insights we gained from interactions with stakeholders
                and experts during the three main stages of the project: finding a project,
                finding an application  and shaping the design.

            <h2>February & March </h2>
            <p>Initially, we considered a wide range of topics, from glucose sensors to
                solar energy, and from ocean clean-ups to artificial organs. The number
                of options seemed unlimited, and our search was scattered. As a source of
                inspiration, we consulted newspaper articles, checked the wiki pages of
                previous iGEM teams and talked to several professors at our university.
                When going through the wiki pages of previous teams, we realized that
                many of them  struggled with the use of their creations outside of the
                laboratory. We also came across an article by Liu et al. (2017), who
                attempted to design a ‘living material’ by means of several layers used
                to entrap bacteria. Inspired by this cool work, we decided we wanted to
                do something similar in order to facilitate the easy use of GMOs.
                However, instead of using several layers for entrapment, we wanted to
                equip our bacteria with their own anchor. After several brainstorm
                meetings, we settled on this challenging subject as the goal of our
                2018 iGEM project!

                <p>From the beginning, the Human Practices took a central role in shaping our 
                    project. When we started our brainstorm sessions in March, we had no clue which
                    topic we wanted to explore. Yet, we wanted it to be relevant to society.
                    During these first months, we got the opportunity to interact with experts
                    and the public to discuss our ideas. These encounters were of great help in
                    our topic selection. During a visit to the Dutch Institute for Public Health
                    and the Environment (RIVM) and the Rathenau Instituut (Dutch organization for
                    technology assessment), we realized that the lack of a safe platform for
                    working with GMOs outside of controlled environments is a problem on itself
                    that deserves a solution. We were excited to tackle this issue with
                    Gelcatraz, but also wanted to work towards a more concrete application. In
                    the time that followed, we consulted several experts and interacted with the
                    public to get feedback on our proposals. Once we had settled on the wound
                    healing application, we interacted with more stakeholders and experts to
                    shape the design of the wound healing patch. We realize that our project
                    would not have been the same without the Human Practices. In the following
                    section, we share the insights we gained from interactions with stakeholders
                    and experts during the three main stages of the project: finding a project,
                    finding an application  and shaping the design .

                <p>From the beginning, the Human Practices took a central role in shaping our 
                    project. When we started our brainstorm sessions in March, we had no clue which
                    topic we wanted to explore. Yet, we wanted it to be relevant to society.
                    During these first months, we got the opportunity to interact with experts
                    and the public to discuss our ideas. These encounters were of great help in
                    our topic selection. During a visit to the Dutch Institute for Public Health
                    and the Environment (RIVM) and the Rathenau Instituut (Dutch organization for
                    technology assessment), we realized that the lack of a safe platform for
                    working with GMOs outside of controlled environments is a problem on itself
                    that deserves a solution. We were excited to tackle this issue with
                    Gelcatraz, but also wanted to work towards a more concrete application. In
                    the time that followed, we consulted several experts and interacted with the
                    public to get feedback on our proposals. Once we had settled on the wound
                    healing application, we interacted with more stakeholders and experts to
                    shape the design of the wound healing patch. We realize that our project
                    would not have been the same without the Human Practices. In the following
                    section, we share the insights we gained from interactions with stakeholders
                    and experts during the three main stages of the project: finding a project,
                    finding an application  and shaping the design .
