            <h1>Integrated Human Practices</h1>
            <p>From the beginning, the Human Practices took a central role in shaping our project. When we started our brainstorm sessions in March, we had no clue which topic we wanted to explore. Yet, we wanted it to be relevant to society. During these first months, we got the opportunity to interact with experts and the public to discuss our ideas. These encounters were of great help in our topic selection. During a visit to the Dutch Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) and the Rathenau Instituut (Dutch organization for technology assessment), we realized that the lack of a safe platform for working with GMOs outside of controlled environments is a problem on itself that deserves a solution. We were excited to tackle this issue with Gelcatraz, but also wanted to work towards a more concrete application. In the time that followed, we consulted several experts and interacted with the public to get feedback on our proposals. Once we had settled on the wound healing application, we interacted with more stakeholders and experts to shape the design of the wound healing patch. We also performed a stakeholder-value analysis  and an ethical analysis  of our design, and we considered safety during all stages of the project for safe-by-design . We realize that our project would not have been the same without the Human Practices.</p>
            <p>In the following section, we share the insights we gained from interactions with stakeholders and experts during the three main stages of the project: <a href="#findingaprojectH2"><b>finding a project</b></a>, <a href="#findinganapplicationH2"><b>finding an application</b></a> and <a href="#shapingthedesignH2"><b>shaping the design</b></a>. Here you can explore our journey of integrated human practices.</p>

            <p>Thanks to the TU/e Contest and various brainstorm sessions, we had settled on the living material project. Although we decided to focus on the adhesin system, we wanted to demonstrate the potential of our platform by applying it to a social problem. To find the ‘perfect’ application, we consulted various experts, interacted with the public and attended a biotech conference. We also reflected on the ethical consequences of our potential applications before settling on wound infections.</p>

                    <h3>February & March </h3>
                    <p>Initially, we considered a wide range of topics, from glucose sensors to
                        solar energy, and from ocean clean-ups to artificial organs. The number
                        of options seemed unlimited, and our search was scattered. As a source of
                        inspiration, we consulted newspaper articles, checked the wiki pages of
                        previous iGEM teams and talked to several professors at our university.
                        When going through the wiki pages of previous teams, we realized that
                        many of them  struggled with the use of their creations outside of the
                        laboratory. We also came across an article by Liu et al. (2017), who
                        attempted to design a ‘living material’ by means of several layers used
                        to entrap bacteria. Inspired by this cool work, we decided we wanted to
                        do something similar in order to facilitate the easy use of GMOs.
                        However, instead of using several layers for entrapment, we wanted to
                        equip our bacteria with their own anchor. After several brainstorm
                        meetings, we settled on this challenging subject as the goal of our
                        2018 iGEM project!

                    <h3>April & May - TU/e contest</h3>
                    <p>Right after we decided to anchor bacteria to a hydrogel, we decided to register for the TU/e Contest . This is an annual ideation contest organized by our university, in which students are encouraged to develop their innovative ideas into start-ups. The contest was intended for students who already had a clear idea that they wanted to bring to the market. Unfortunately, our project was still quite vague (‘adhering bacteria to a hydrogel’). Nevertheless, our participation was still useful. We got to meet companies, participate in workshops and pitch our project to the public. Along the way, we received quite some feedback from the participating companies.</p>

                                <p>As we did not have a clear project yet, not all workshops were as useful as they could have been in a later stage. Nevertheless, we are glad we participated. Not only because we won the audience prize (€1000!), but also because we were forced to make our ideas more concrete. Our Human Practices trajectory thus clearly benefitted from our participation in the TU/e Contest. If you want to know how we won the audience prize, please have a look here.</p>

                    <p>In May, we were invited to The Hague for a Dutch iGEM meet-up organized by two public institutes: The National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM ) and the Rathenau Institute, an institute for technology assessment. The theme of the meet-up was Human Practices. As we had only just started our Human Practices trajectory, this day was a great way to get inspired.</p>

                                <p>day Our day started with a presentation on the different stages of a project. After the pitches by all six Dutch teams, we got the opportunity to speed date  with seven experts on the topics of biosafety, security, bioethics, policy and regulations: Zoë Robaey, Cécile van der Vlugt, Pim Klaassen, Niek Savelkoul, Pieter van Boheemen, Lilian van Hove and Jaco Westra. They provided us with helpful feedback on our plans and we discussed potential applications of Gelcatraz. They encouraged us to focus on previous iGEM projects that could have been improved with our platform. In fact, wound healing was one of the applications they mentioned! It was also great to meet the other Dutch teams for the first time and to learn what they were working on. We would like to thank the Rathenau Institute and RIVM for the inspiring day!</p>

                    <h3>May 16, 2018. Meeting Prof. Dr. Patricia Dankers</h3>
                    <p>As we had decided to develop a living material, we wanted to speak to an expert in the field of biomaterials to ask for some feedback on the design and explore possible applications. We therefore contacted professor Patricia Dankers, a professor in biomedical materials for regenerative medicine. We discussed our preliminary selection of dextran as our hydrogel. Prof. Dankers encouraged us to limit ourselves to this gel instead of also exploring other options, as dextran is known to have affinity for glucose and the production of multiple gels would be time-consuming.</p>

                                <p>Regarding potential applications, Dankers recommended to make optimal use of the integrated bacteria by positioning the material on an organ (skin, heart, kidneys) and having them produce something. As examples, we discussed the cases of kidney failure and diabetic wounds. This was already the second time that we were recommended to look into <b>wound infections</b> as an application! She pointed our attention to the huge problem of skin infections which develop antibiotic resistance. According to Dankers, our patch would be very suitable for this purpose, as good bacteria could fight the bad ones. Alternatively, we could try to create a patch to sense kidney failure and secrete medicine in response. With both applications, we would make optimal use of the integrated bacteria by using their secretive powers.</p>

                    <p>Inspired by the Dutch iGEM meet-up and by our participation in the TU/e Contest  , we were determined to find an application relevant to society. During several brainstorm and literature sessions, we composed a list of possible applications. Inspired by work performed by previous iGEM teams,  the experts we talked to during the Dutch meet-up and by our meeting with professor Dankers, we decided to investigate bacterial sensors (malaria, urea, scabies), kidney failure, water filtration, bone infections, vaccines, eczema and wound infections.</p>

                    <p>Our first conference! With the other Dutch iGEM teams, we were invited to present a poster at the Netherlands Biotechnology Congress . During the several talks we learned about new developments in biotechnology and public acceptance of GMOs. The highlight of the day was an intriguing talk by Marc Lynas, a British environmental activist and journalist who explained how he moved from violently opposing GMO crops to supporting them. The conference also offered a platform to discuss our project with biotechnologists and with the overgrad winning team of iGEM 2017, TU Delft. After a few drinks and a good meal, we returned home with a lot of new insights.</p>

                                <p>Dr. Lily Frank gave us some valuable suggestions regarding controversial issue of synthetic biology. For instance, Lily strongly recommended us not to choose an application relevant to third world countries before the technology has been properly tested in our own country. That would conflict with the principles of justice and fairness, which prescribe a fair distribution of benefits and burdens globally and across society. This was interesting food for thought, as we had been considering creating a malaria sensor. Furthermore, we learned that the novelty of synthetic biology as a field complicates risk assessment, as many of the potential benefits and risks are still uncertain. Finally, Lily recommended us some frameworks. We used these for an ethical analysis which we performed over the summer .</p>

She said that this idea as well as the needleless vaccines would have a huge potential.

She is an assistant professor in mechanobiology in bone tissue engineering at Eindhoven University of Technology.

                                <p>We proposed our plan to combat bone infections with bacteria producing lysostaphin, encapsulated in a hydrogel. She would not use it for bone infections, because only a hydrogel on bone is not enough (not load-bearing), and combinations with other materials are very complicated. Also , some interesting alternatives eliminating the need for secondary surgery are already being developed right now. And there are some (non-ideal) alternatives which guarantee a reasonable quality of life, which makes it more difficult to find people willing to take the risk of incorporating living GMOs into their body. However, our hydrogel may still be helpful if we turn it into a composite of hydrogel and granules. But for the scope of this project (limited time), she instead recommended us to focus on skin infections. She believes it is very promising. Furthermore, the need for it will only grow as people live longer. This means they develop more decubiti’s and more metabolic syndromes, which in turn increases the risk of skin infections. These infections even have the potential to spread to the bone, worsening the situation. She also gave us some advice in how to handle the bacterial invasion problem: she suggested to research ion release. </p>

                                <p>Some applications were simply rejected for a lack of feasibility, such as the scabies detection system (no proper biomarkers available). Furthermore, we had realized that the use of GMOs in the body would bring undesired safety hazards. For this reason, we eliminated the bone healing and kidney regeneration applications from our list. Thanks to our ethical analysis, we had realized that applications relevant to the Western world would be preferable over Third World applications from a justice point of view. This issue made us prefer the wound infections application over needleless vaccines and malaria sensors. Finally, the application must be feasible, as it would not be the initial focus of our laboratory work (this is the gel-adhesin system). As several teams had already been working on skin infections or related subjects (e.g. burn wounds) and several antibacterial proteins (bacteriocins) had been described in the literature, the skin infections topic met this requirement. A final important criterium was that the use of living GMOs must be beneficial compared to existing solutions in order to justify the use of living bacteria. We believed we could meet this requirement in two ways: firstly, by developing a secretable bacteriocin, we eliminate the need for (expensive) protein purification. Secondly, the use of living systems enables the relatively straight-forward integration of sensing and secretion.</p>

            <p>Once we had decided to focus on wound healing, there were many new questions to be answered by the Human Practices team. How to offer patients suffering from infected wounds the best possible treatment? Is there indeed a need for a new treatment? What requirements does our material need to fulfill? What are the medical details of the wounds? Which bacteria do we need to kill? To collect answers to these questions and many more, we contacted several experts and stakeholders.</p>

                    <p>In our search for existing and future wound treatments, we came across Plasmacure.
                        Plasmacure is a start-up aiming to cure chronic wounds, especially diabetic wounds,
                        with plasma (fourth phase of matter). They developed a small machine producing
                        plasma which can be connected to a disposable plaster. The plaster is applied to
                        the wound. During a one-minute treatment, the wound is exposed to plasma. This
                        should be enough to kill all bacteria and fungi on the wound. This treatment is
                        repeated ten times. The product is still under development, but the first small
                        clinical trial showed positive results for half of the patients.  During a meeting
                        with their CMO Koen Lim, Lim was so kind to sketch the wound market and its
                        problems, to share his solution and to give us feedback on our plans. We also
                        learned about the long and winding trajectory of bringing a medical device to the
                        market. This resulted in our problem sketch.</p>

                                <p>Furthermore, Lim provided some feedback on our idea to combat skin infections with lysostaphin and shared some requirements our device should fulfill. Most importantly, the patch must be user-friendly such that it can be applied by a nurse at home. It must thus be safe and easy to handle. Koen Lim liked the ability of our patch to be freeze-dried. He also said we should aim to kill the major bacterial strains contributing to wound-infections rather than one strain only. We will thus examine the option to make our bacteria produce more proteins than only lysostaphin.</p>
                                <h4>Insights</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Wound care is no medical specialism, which means that care is poorly coordinated. Due to a lack of standards, the quality of treatments differs between hospitals.</li>
                                    <li>Currently, <span class="emph">no proper treatment</span> exists for complex wounds. This makes wound healing a “desperate market: one dies with their wounds, but not due to them.”</li>
                                    <li>Wound care is estimated to cost the Dutch health care system 1.5-2 billion euros annually.</li>
                                    <li>Home care nurses play a crucial role in wound care, as most of the treatments take place at home. It must thus be easy for nurses to work with our plaster.</li>
                                    <li>Almost all diabetic wounds are <span class="emph">infected</span>. Almost everyone uses antibiotics for that reason. Due to increasing antibiotic resistance, treatments are less effective. <span class="emph">A clear need exists for alternatives!</span> An additional reason why an alternative to systemic antibiotics is demanded, is the disturbance of the gut microbiota caused by antibiotics. Diabetic patients generally already have a disturbed gut microbiota, and this is worsened by antibiotics.</li>
                                    <li>The most <span class="emph">difficult wounds</span> occur in older people with poor blood circulation. This makes that wounds barely heal, particularly in the legs and feet, regions which suffer most from reduced blood flow. These older patients are usually <span class="emph">diabetic patients</span>, as diabetes affects blood vessels. At the same time, the reduced blood flow affects the nerve system, making that patients feel less pain. They may not notice that they have a wound on their feet. In the worst-case scenario, feet or legs must be amputated. In that case, five-year survival rates are even worse than for many cancer patients. Sometimes, heart patients experience similar problems as diabetic patients.</li>
                                    <li>Another group of patients that may benefit from our treatment are <span class="emph">burn wound</span> patients. Burn wounds are also often infected.</li>
                                    <li>It may be helpful to stimulate blood flow while applying our plaster, as blood flow has been demonstrated to be crucial in wound healing</li>
                                    <li>We should aim to kill the <span class="emph">major bacterial</span> strains contributing to wound-infections rather than one strain only. Lim did not know which strains are most problematic.</li>
                                    <li>We learned about the long and winding trajectory of (clinical) testing required before market launch of medical devices.</li>

Maasstad Hospital and Dr. Edgar Peters gave us more insight in which bacterial strains cause the most problems in wounds.</li>

                                <p>For instance, iGEM Düsseldorf warned us for the risk of overcrowding of the hydrogel upon long-term use. This resulted in a potential collaboration with them; we may be able to use their quorum sensing Biobrick to prevent overcrowding, or perhaps even to prevent infiltration of the material by foreign bacteria. We also received useful feedback from Julia Müller, a PhD candidate at TU München who is attempting to print hydrogels. We would like to thank iGEM Munich for the perfect organization and all the participants for their feedback and ideas.</p>

                                <p>he only recommends using bacterial sensors as ‘second choice’ sensors. That is, when bacteria are anyway present in the system (e.g. in the gut), and when they can also be used for sensing to favor integration. Our lysostaphin secretion would be a good example of this, as it could be combined with quorum sensing to only secrete lysostaphin in the presence of S. aureus. Prins urged us to ensure that different functionalities can be regulated individually, as this makes testing and optimization much easier. We will do this by using distinct operators for our adhesin, secretion system and lysostaphin. He also highlighted the importance of safety, to prevent destroying our reputation and that of the SynBio field.</p>

                    <p>Inspired by our conversion with Prof. Menno Prins, we decided to take the safety of our device a step further by integrating a kill switch. This would minimize the risk of bacterial escape even further. By making our bacteria dependent on an artificial amino acid and including this in the medium, we could ensure that bacteria which escape the gel die. Through point mutations, one makes essential proteins dependent on an artificial amino acid. To examine this option, we contacted professor Jan van Hest, who has a lot of experience with artificial amino acids.</p>

                                <h3>Augus 13, 2018. Kill switches: Meeting with Prof. dr. Jan van Hest</h3>
                            </div>

                                <p>Prof. dr. Jan van Hest was so kind to share his knowledge with us. He warned us that some artificial amino acids used for this purpose are still present, in varying quantities, in nature. Kill switches relying on such an amino acid are thus not completely safe. We discussed some potential artificial amino acids to use. Van Hest ultimately advised us to use azidophenylalanine, an artificial amino acid which is not present in nature. Its implementation is also efficient, as the required tRNA and synthetase are easily producible by bacteria. Van Hest recommended us to start with only one point mutation. Multiple mutations would be saver, but could complicate the synthesis of essential proteins, leading to cell dead.</p>
                                <p>Another topic we discussed with Van Hest, is the option to replace the use of antibiotic resistance genes in R&D by dependence on artificial amino acids. As we ultimately want to use our living material on patients, we do not want to risk antibiotic resistant bacteria escaping into the environment. Van Hest informed us that dependence on artificial amino acids could be a serious alternative, albeit not much used yet. He said that currently researchers simply use antibiotic resistance genes because of their ease of use and wide availability. However, dependence on artificial amino acids as a selection mechanism may be even more reliable than antibiotic resistance, as bacteria tend to get rid of genes that are temporarily unused, e.g. in the absence of antibiotics. As genes related to artificial amino acid dependence generally encode for essential proteins, they do not run this risk.</p>

                                    <li>Dependence on artificial amino acids is a feasible method to implement a kill switch into our design, and thereby make our living material an even saver platform for the use of GMOs.</li>
                                    <li>For optimal safety we must choose an artificial amino acid not present at all in nature.</li>
                                    <li>One must strike a balance between safety and feasibility while choosing the number of point mutations to make.</li>
                                    <li>Dependence on artificial amino acids may form a saver alternative to antibiotic resistance as a selection mechanism in R&D.</li>

                    <h3>July – August 2018 iGEMers Guide to the Future – Stakeholder value matrix</h3>
                    <p>Inspired by the iGEM’ers Guide to the Future, we performed a stakeholder-value matrix. Over the course of July and August, we reflected on the consequences of our design for several stakeholders. The entire analysis can be found <a href=""></a>here. From the stakeholder-value analysis, it is concluded that Gelcatraz introduces significant benefits to most stakeholders discussed. Importantly, patients will benefit from the plaster as they will experience less pain, enjoy faster wound healing and thus get a better quality of life. The major safety issues have been addressed under safe-by-design. Medical professionals will also appreciate Gelcatraz as a new tool which will facilitate and ease their treatments.</p>

                    <p>During the introduction week for new students, we got the opportunity to promote iGEM at a fair. We talked to new students from all kinds of disciplines about synthetic biology and the iGEM competition. The students were very curious to hear why we decided to spend our summer in the lab! We also introduced the newbies to our iGEM project and asked them whether they would wear a patch with bacteria on their skin. Interestingly, after sharing some information on the role of the bacteria in our design, they seemed to agree that they would wear the patch if we could ensure the safety of the patch.</p>

                    <p>As several experts  told us that our patch could have potential as a treatment of burn wounds, we wanted to know more about the options and requirements. We contacted Dr. Jan Dokter, specialized in burn wounds at the Maasstad Ziekenhuis. This hospital in Rotterdam hosts one of the three Dutch centers specialized in the treatment of burn wounds. They treat approximately 300 patients annually, who represent 45% of all Dutch patients with severe burn wounds. Dr. Dokter was so kind to invite us over for a visit.</p>

                                <h3>August 27, 2018. Burn wound center Maasstad Ziekenhuis</h3>
                            </div>
                            <div class="modal-body">
                                <p>After getting changed into a blue apron (burn wounds a very prone to infections indeed), we were welcomed by what seemed to be the entire team of the burn wound department. Dr. Dokter and colleagues told us that the treatment  of (antibiotic-resistant) bacterial infections is high on their priority list. This is because burn wounds are never sterile, since they are always colonized by bacteria. The goal of the medical team is to contain the bacteria and to prevent them from developing into an infection, as this could be lethal. Currently, containment is done through systemic use of antibiotics, mechanical cleaning of the wounds and/or antibacterial creams. However, they recently observed an increase in antibiotic-resistant bacteria such as MRSA, meaning that an alternative like ours would be very welcome. They told us they would already order some patches if possible. 😉They also foresaw benefits for the patients, as wound dressings must be changed regularly: two times a week for small burn wounds, and even daily for larger ones. As changing is painful for the patients, it would be great to use a wound dressing like ours which could stay on the wound for a prolonged time while ensuring drugs are administered to the wound.</p>
                                <p>Although they were very enthusiastic about our product, they also saw some room for improvement. Their advice was to complement lysostaphin with other systems to target different bacteria. Bacteria found by the Maasstad burn wound center in burn wounds include Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), Streptococci, Pseudomonas (e.g. P. aeruginosa), Klebsiella, Enterobacter, E. coli, Serratia, Proteus, Citrobacter and Acinetobacter baumanii. However, not all of these are of equal danger. S. aureus is recently getting more problematic because of a surge in dangerous toxin-producing strains found in burn wounds. This is also what drew Dokter’s attention to our project. Other strains considered particularly toxic are Streptococci, Pseudomona, Klebsiella and Enterobacter. General, Dr. Dokter told us that Gram-negative bacteria pose a higher threat to patients than Gram-positive ones. The team also warned us that bacteria such as S. aureus growing in biofilms are particularly challenging to get rid of. They were thus very happy to hear that lysostaphin targets bacteria growing in biofilms.</p>
                                <p>Another problem recognized by the medical practitioners regarding the current treatment methods is the systemic use of antibiotics which increases the risk of resistance. To find out which bacteria contaminate the wound, they usually culture them. However, this takes four days, forcing the doctors to use systemic antibiotics to prevent the outbreak of an infection. As the systemic antibiotics used are not specific, this treatment contributes to antibiotic resistance while the treatment may not even be effective against the specific bacteria colonizing the wound. Once the results of the culture are known, a more specific treatment is selected. The medical team therefore believed it would be very beneficial if we could expand on our patch by integrating a sensing system, to secrete the appropriate type of bacteriocin only when the relevant bacteria are present. This would decrease the risk of resistance developed against our bacteriocins drastically. They said it would be great if we could include different types of bacteria secreting different bacteriocins in combination with a sensing system, as it would directly improve the treatment efficacy and prevent building antibiotic resistance.</p>
                                <p>We would like to once again thank Jan Dokter and the entire team of the Maasstad burn wound center for their hospitality and kind feedback. Inspired by some in-depth knowledge of the most problematic bacterial strains and the requirements for wound healing and encouraged by your positive feedback, we will continue our efforts to improve our design even further! 😊</p>

                                    <li>Burn wounds are always colonized, meaning that it is crucial to control and limit the bacteria growing in the wound.</li>
                                    <li>Burn wounds are colonized and potentially infected by several bacterial strains. Particularly the Gram-negative strains and bacteria growing in biofilms are virulent and difficult to target.</li>
                                    <li><em>S. aureus</em> is increasingly challenging doctors treating burn wounds because of a surge in toxin-producing strains.</li>
                                    <li>Current burn wound treatments are mostly mechanic in combination with antibacterial creams.</li>
                                    <li>A hydrogel forms a perfect environment for wounds, considering that burn wounds benefit from a gel-like environment. We must check that liquid produced by edema can be absorbed. Burn wounds do not need oxygen to heal.</li>
                                    <li>The use of systemic antibiotics while researching the type of bacteria colonizing a wound contributes to the development of antibiotic resistance, but is not always effective against the bacteria present on the wound. The development of targeted treatments in combination with a detection method for specific bacterial strains would thus be very useful, as it will increase efficacy while lowering the risk of resistance against the treatment.</li>

                                <p>After a summer of reflection, we finished our ethical analysis . In this ethical analysis, we reflected on our Gelcatraz design with respect to five values: public beneficence, responsible stewardship, intellectual freedom and responsibility, democratic deliberation and justice & fairness. We conclude that our product benefits individuals as well as society, and that its benefits and burdens are well-distributed.  We identified some issues that need to be addressed, such as the use of Gelcatraz by amateurs and the yet unidentified risks introduced by synthetic biochemistries. However, we believe that these risks are mostly covered by the several safety levels we integrated in the design.</p>

                    <h3>Sept 21, 2018 Visit to PAMM: Foundation for Infective Diseases and Pathology</h3>
                    <p>PAMM is a foundation for Infective Diseases and Pathology. They perform diagnostics for hospitals in the region and are also involved in prevention. We are indeed very lucky to have PAMM as one of our <a href="http://2018.igem.org/Team:TU-Eindhoven/Sponsors">main partners</a>! PAMM is not only helping us financially, but also offered help with the functional testing of lysostaphin.</p>

                                <p>As we had realized that working with S. aureus brings significant safety issues (check our safe-by-design page  for more information), we reached out to PAMM for help. To discuss the collaboration, we were invited to visit their laboratories. On Friday September 21st, we met with Kees Verduin and Jeroen Tjhie, two of their microbiologists. We presented them with our progress and discussed some issues we were still struggling with. It was very encouraging to hear that Kees and Jeroen saw a lot of potential in our approach. Afterwards, Kees gave us a tour through their impressive laboratories. It was interesting to notice the differences with our own lab. We were very impressed with the amount of work that had been automated! We also learned a lot about the safety measures they implement in their different labs with varying safety levels. Kees ensured us that our experiments with S. aureus will be nothing special for them in terms of safety. 😉 After this tour, we cannot wait to come back for our own experiments!</p>

                                <p>We asked Dr. Peters about his opinion on the feasibility of our project. He believed our project sounded very promising, but he was concerned about regulations which will make its market launch difficult. It would thus be important to demonstrate that E. coli cannot escape the patch. If we achieve this, it would be great to regulate the production and secretion of various bacteriocins through a sensing system. Peters expects that upon the extermination of one bacterial strain, other (malignant or benign) ones may take over. A huge advantage of our GMO-based system would thus be its flexibility to adapt to a changing wound flora. As most current antiseptic bandages are ineffective, this new treatment would be useful.</p>

                                    <li><em>S. aureus</em> is the most important infection-causing bacteria on diabetic wounds. Streptococcus comes second, although he has encountered them less frequency lately. Pseudonomas is more important on burn wounds than on diabetic wounds.</li>
                                    <li>Most existing antiseptic bandages are not effective.</li>
                                    <li>It will be important to demonstrate that E. coli cannot escape the bandage in order to conform to regulations.</li>
                                    <li>It is not likely that our plaster will cause inflammation, as it is no part of the body. It may be smart to change the patch on a regularly base, however. Currently, bandages are changed every one or two days. The plaster will probably be required until the wound closes, which may take months.</li>
                                    <li>It is to be expected that once the bandage will have eradicated one type of bacteria growing on the wound, others will take over. Therefore, an integrated sensing system regulating the production and secretion of a range of bacteriocins would be the ultimate solution.</li>
                                    <li>Patients affected by diabetic wounds are usually 60-70 years old, they suffer from peripheral neuropathy, vascular disease and diabetes. From all diabetic patients, 65% will develop neuropathy. 20-25% of those patients will develop wounds on their feet, of which half gets infected.</li>

                                <p>We were told that there are two types of wounds, and three types of basic ways to distinguish what to do with a wound. The decision about what you need to do with a wound is very simple. It is based on color! If a wound is black, that means that there is necrotic tissue which has to be removed. If the wound is of a yellow color, the wound is not yet clean and there are still some remains of bacteria or tissue left. This means that the wound has to be cleaned, but there is no dead tissue. A red color means that the wound is not contaminated, but still needs to be protected and covered. These are things that we must take into account when designing a patch for wound infections.  We were also told that the amount of exudate of a wound is very important. If a wound is too dry, it will not heal. Is there too much fluid? Not optimal either. Treating a dry wound is performed by the addition of a hydrogel to increase the fluid levels of the wound. In that respect, our gel would provide an ideal environment for dry wounds.</p>
                                <p>After some information about the wound healing process, we asked about wound-related statistics. It turns out that of all wounds, about 80% are acute and will heal on their own without too much care. However, 20% will become chronic and of these 20%, more than half will get infected and thus requires attention. These wounds are estimated to be approximately 100.000 wounds. This means that in the Netherlands, 100.000s wounds annually could benefit from our solution.</p>
                                <p>Since an antibiotic treatment usually takes around ten days, it would be good to aim at removing the infection in ten days or less with our solution. That way, we can prove that our solution would be better than current treatments.</p>

                                    <li><em>Staphylococcus</em> aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are indeed most of the time the cause of wound infections. Streptococci however are also problematic.</li>
                                    <li>5% of surgical wounds get infected.</li>
                                    <li>Current treatments of surgical wound infections usually comprise incision and drainage followed by targeted antibiotics. The use of targeted antibiotics however requires results from the culture of wound samples, as possible resistances must be recognized. Before the results of these tests are known, doctors use Augmentin, a type of penicillin. It is used systemically. When the wound smells like Pseudomonas, the antibiotic Ciproxin or bandages drained in acetic acid are used. The use of intravenous antibiotics is burdensome for patients, while the application of soaked bandages is labor-intensive. Therefore, new treatments options are desired.</li>

                                <h4>What type of wounds do you have?</h4>
                                <p class="myAnswer">Diabetic wounds which heal slowly. One of the wounds on my feet got infected. It took six (!) weeks of systemic antibiotics to get rid of it. This had a great impact on my well-being.</p>
                                <h4>How are your experiences with continuous wound care?</h4>
                                <p class="myAnswer">The pain and discomfort caused by the treatments are limited. Except for the consequences of antibiotic treatments.</p>
                                <h4>How much discomfort do your wounds bring you?</h4>
                                <p class="myAnswer">A lot, since my wounds are large. Furthermore, they are pretty deep and cleaning them may make cause them to expand.</p>
                                <h4>How long have you been suffering from your wounds?</h4>
                                <p class="myAnswer">Since February.</p>
                                <h4>Do your wounds have an impact on your life?</h4>
                                <p class="myAnswer">They have a large impact. I can barely walk due to the wounds on my feet. Heel erg veel. Omdat het wonden op de voet zijn kan er nauwelijks op gelopen worden. In February, dead tissue was removed, causing a big hole. After that, my blood circulation reduced, which has been solved by means of a bypass. On August 21st, the wound was cleaned for another time, which has helped the wound to start curing.</p>
                                <h4>How satisfied are you with your current treatment?</h4>
                                <p class="myAnswer">Since the wound has started to cure, it has been fine. Every now and then, I am coming for a check-up.</p>
                                <h4>What are your thoughts on the use of living bacteria for the treatment of wound infections?</h4>
                                <p class="myAnswer">Considering grubs, living material on wounds is not a bad idea. If it is safe and it works, why not? I think it is better than antibiotics, which cause resistance and a lot of side-effects on the liver and kidneys when used systemically, like in my case.</p>
                                <hr>
                                <h4>Insights</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The wound care process itself is not too bad. However, the wounds are usually large, resulting in a relatively large infection. This means that it takes a lot of antibiotics and a lot of time to resolve this infection. A large, systematic antibiotic treatment has a large impact on the body. A more local, surface solution would thus be better. </li>
                                    <li>Karel is fine with the idea of using living bacteria as a treatment. </li>
                                </ul>
                                <h4>Follow-up</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>We will do everything we can to prevent systemic side effects of our treatment.</li>
                                    <li>Karel’s positive feedback motivated us to work even harder. 😊 We are glad he is not taken back by the concept of adding living bacteria to the wound.</li>

            <h1>Conclusions</h1>
            <p>The discussions with experts and stakeholders were a valuable part of our iGEM trajectory. Thanks to their continuous input, we learned for which applications our living material would be most relevant. This made it much easier to settle on a wound healing patch as an application for Gelcatraz. A further set of interactions with medical doctors, experts on infectious diseases and others helped us to get a clear overview of the problem at hand. This helped us tremendously in the <a href="http://2018.igem.org/Team:TU-Eindhoven/Applied_Design">product design process</a> . It was extremely motivating to experience the enthusiasm of medical doctors when we told them about our project. This inspired us to work even harder! These experts also had interesting advice for improvements on our design. As a result of the stakeholder and expert interactions described above, we took several decisions and made adaptations. Summarized:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The choice for dextran as our hydrogel of choice was confirmed by a discussion with Prof. Patricia Dankers.</li>
                <li>Input from RIVM experts, Dutch biotechnologists, dr. Sandra Hofmann, and an anonymous dermatologist made us decide on wound healing as our field of application. This decision was further informed by a discussion with ethicist Dr. Lily Frank, during which we realized that a product for our own country is preferred over one aimed at developing countries considering a fair distribution of risks.</li>
                <li>We researched the chemical safety of our hydrogel and its synthesis after advice from Lori Goff and risk assessment expert Cécile van der Vlugt. We <a href="TODO: insert link to to hydrogel results or ‘demonstrate’ (gold medal #4)">demonstrated</a>  the chemical safety of the final product and proposed some adaptations t o improve the future safety of the synthesis.</li>
                <li>Thanks to a visit to Plasmacure, we decided to research the requirements for a patch against burn wounds and against diabetic wounds. This resulted in visits to the Maasstad Hospital (burn wound center), Expertise Center Wound Care, and in calls with a patient suffering from chronic wounds and an expert on diabetic wounds and infectious diseases. We learned that besides <em>S. aureus</em>, <em>Streptococci</em> and <em>P. aeruginosa</em> would be our main targets for diabetic wounds and burn wounds, respectively. We designed an additional <a href="link to registry page for Pyocin S5.">BioBrick (pyocin S5)</a> to target <em>P. aeruginosa</em> and we selected an existing BioBrick to inhibit <em>Streptococci</em>.</li>
                <li>Several stakeholders stressed the importance of safety. Therefore, we designed a kill switch  as an additional safety level, based on advice from Prof. Jan van Hest.</li>
                <li>The doctors in the Maasstad Hospital and from the VUmc made us realize that a sensing mechanism to regulate our secretion system would be a great asset. We subsequently <a href="TODO: Link to design or applied design">designed one</a>.</li>
                <li>Wound healing professionals emphasized user-friendliness as a design requirement for the plaster. We integrated this wish in the <a href="http://2018.igem.org/Team:TU-Eindhoven/Applied_Design">future scenario of our plaster</a>, with a freeze-dryable, sterilely packed plaster ready for use. We will make sure the plaster can stay on the wound for a few days to limit patient suffering, but not longer to minimize the risk of inflammation.</li>
                <li>We used PAMM’s expertise and facilities to work safely with <em>S. aureus</em>.</li>

                <p>From the beginning, the Human Practices took a central role in shaping our 
                    project. When we started our brainstorm sessions in March, we had no clue which
                    topic we wanted to explore. Yet, we wanted it to be relevant to society.
                    During these first months, we got the opportunity to interact with experts
                    and the public to discuss our ideas. These encounters were of great help in
                    our topic selection. During a visit to the Dutch Institute for Public Health
                    and the Environment (RIVM) and the Rathenau Instituut (Dutch organization for
                    technology assessment), we realized that the lack of a safe platform for
                    working with GMOs outside of controlled environments is a problem on itself
                    that deserves a solution. We were excited to tackle this issue with
                    Gelcatraz, but also wanted to work towards a more concrete application. In
                    the time that followed, we consulted several experts and interacted with the
                    public to get feedback on our proposals. Once we had settled on the wound
                    healing application, we interacted with more stakeholders and experts to
                    shape the design of the wound healing patch. We realize that our project
                    would not have been the same without the Human Practices. In the following
                    section, we share the insights we gained from interactions with stakeholders
                    and experts during the three main stages of the project: finding a project,
                    finding an application  and shaping the design .

                <p>The Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) challenged us to take part in their safe-by-design challenge. This challenge was about integrating safety into different phases of our project. To get started, we wrote a proposal which we discussed with RIVM experts over Skype. We got to realize that safety goes beyond technical issues and that it is important to consider safety from the initial ideation stage to the final implementation.</p>
                <p>For this project, we broke safety down into eight different issues, which we had recognized with the help of some stakeholders and experts (see our integrated practices ). Once we had identified the main issues, we consulted more experts and stakeholders to think of possible solutions. An overview of our Safe-by-Design trajectory can be found in the infographic below. The details are provided underneath.</p>

                        <p>As we described on the <a href="http://2018.igem.org/Team:TU-Eindhoven/Applied_Design">Product Design</a> page, the risk of environmental escape limits the use
                            of genetically modified organisms. Environmental escape not only is a risk that should be
                            avoided out of public and environmental safety reasons, but also contributes to public fear
                            of GMOs (<a href="#sbdref1">1</a>). We consulted several RIVM experts who confirmed that escape risk is a limiting
                            factor in the advancement of GMO technologies. Environmental safety threats related to GMO
                            escape includes the damaging of ecosystems, the risk of horizontal gene transfer and effects

                        <p>To research the problem of antibiotic resistance and the need for antibiotics reduction, we approached several
                            experts. All of them highlighted the urgency of the problem. <a onclick="changeHPTabs(this)" data-target="#intergrated-container" href="#plasmacure">Plasmacure</a> as well as the doctors in the
                            <a onclick="changeHPTabs(this)" data-target="#intergrated-container" href="#maasstad">Maasstad Hospital</a> explained that <em>S. aureus</em> and <em>P. aeruginosa</em> are increasingly becoming resistant against
                            commonly used antibiotics. This makes treatment more difficult and even puts patients’ lives at risk. We also
                            learned that the use of systemic, unspecific antibiotics contributes to the development of antibiotic
                            resistance, as described under Product Design . 
                        </p>
                        <p>To contribute to a solution for the treatment of antibiotic resistant infections, we designed our living
                            material to secrete bacteriocins as an alternative to antibiotics. Details on their functioning can be found
                            here. Immunity to lysostaphin has not been commonly observed, but it possible <a href="#sbdref11">(11)</a>.
                            We aim to reduce this risk by integrating a quorum sensing system in the design. This way, the relevant
                            bacteriocins will only be secreted in the presence of <em>S. aureus</em> and/or <em>P. aeruginosa</em>.
                        </p>
                        <p>Cécile van der Vlugt, risk assessment expert at the RIVM, told us that the use of antibiotics in research
                            and development is not an urgent problem, as the quantities used are low, and the types of antibiotics
                            use are generally basic ones. For those antibiotics, many alternatives still exist in the unlikely case
                            of resistance developed due to research work. Nevertheless, we asked <a onclick="changeHPTabs(this)" data-target="#intergrated-container" href="#vanhest">professor Van Hest</a> about the
                            possibilities of replacing the commonly used antibiotic resistances with a dependence on artificial
                            amino acids. He said that, albeit not yet used, dependence on artificial amino acids as a selection
                            mechanism may be even more reliable than antibiotic resistance. The reason is that bacteria tend to get
                            rid of genes that are temporarily unused, e.g. in the absence of antibiotics. As genes related to
                            artificial amino acid dependence generally encode for essential proteins, they do not run this risk.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, our project offers a solution to the treatment of infections caused by antibiotic
                            resistant bacteria. We already reflected on ways to prevent resistance against our own bacteriocins.
                            Finally, we explored how we as scientists may limit the use of antibiotics in R&D to prevent the
                            development of additional resistance.</p>

                            in the final product?  Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) are regulations which ensure the safety and
                            quality of food and medicine. As part of GMP, it is thus important to protect the chemical safety of

                            topics. In short, our research revealed that all toxic components are removed by extensive dialysis
                            of the methacrylated dextran. Furthermore, a leakage test showed that no leakage occurs from the gels

                        <h3>Toxic chemicals and intermediates </h3>
                        <p>Dextran itself is biocompatible and safe, but its synthesis and polymerization require several toxic
                            chemicals. Furthermore, some toxic intermediates are produced.  While handling these chemicals, we
                            take all required precautions such as working in the fume hood and wearing protective gloves.
                            However, it would be even better to replace them by less toxic equivalents. We researched
                            replacement options for two steps: the synthesis of methacrylated dextran and polymerization of
                            methacrylated dextran into gels.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Synthesis of methacrylated dextran</h4>
                        <p>For the synthesis of the gel, we use some toxic chemicals, the most important being glycidyl
                            methacrylate (GMA) and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). GMA is carcinogenic but required to
                            functionalize the hydroxyl groups of dextran. We handle it with syringes to avoid exposure.
                            Furthermore, we remove all traces of GMA after the synthesis and confirmed this with H-NMR.
                            The final product is thus completely safe. DMAP is a base that acts as a catalyst for the
                            coupling of GMA to the dextran molecules. It is toxic if swallowed and fatal in contact with
                            skin. In the absence of a catalyst, no GMA incorporation could be detected (5). However, we
                            researched alternatives to catalyse the reaction. Triethylamine and pyridine are no reasonable
                            alternatives due to the associated high conversion times (5).  Another alternative for DMAP
                            could be tri-ethylenediamine, also known as DABCO. DABCO is like DMAP an organic base and
                            therefore it can theoretically catalyse the methacrylation reaction. However, unlike DMAP,
                            DABCO possesses less toxic properties and DABCO is much safer to handle than DMAP. DABCO is
                            from an economical point of view also a better choice as its commercially available for a lower
                            price. A downside to using DABCO as a catalyst for this methacrylation reaction is that it is
                            less basic than DMAP (6). As the deprotonation of hydroxyl groups by a base is the driving force
                            for the reaction, the reaction time will most likely increase when DABCO is employed as a
                            catalyst instead of DMAP. A comparison of the performance of DABCO in our reaction is required
                            to make an informed choice between DMAP and DABCO.

                        <p>Methacrylation of the non-hazardous dextran results in molecules with very toxic and carcinogenic
                            properties due to the reactive methacryl groups (7).  No material safety data sheet exist for
                            methacrylated dextran. To safely handle this toxic viscous oil, it is kept in the fume hood at
                            all times and only handled using piston pipettes or syringes. To purify the methacrylated
                            dextran from the organic mixture, <a href="TODO:Hyperlink to hydrogel synthetis page">we dialyse it against demineralized water</a>. To verify the
                            complete removal of the DMSO, DMAP and GMA, the 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum of the
                            dialyzed reaction product was compared with the spectra of pure DMAP and GMA. After 72 hours of
                            dialysis, trace amounts of unidentified by-products could be observed in the NMR spectrum. After
                            one week of dialysis, no more trace amounts of any reactants or byproducts can be observed. The
                            obtained spectrum matches with the one reported in the literature <a href="#sbdref8">(8)</a>. The spectrum of purified

                        <h4>Polymerization of methacrylated dextran</h4>
                        <p>To form the hydrogel, the methacrylated dextran polymers are crosslinked by radical
                            polymerisation in water. The polymerisation is initiated by tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED)
                            and ammonium persulfate (APS). TEMED catalyses the homolytic scission of APS to generate
                            radicals which crosslink the methacrylate groups, resulting in the formation of a hydrogel. APS
                            and TEMED are both flammable and irritable. Because TEMED is a catalyst, we only work with
                            small amounts of the substance (10 microliter at a time) using pipets, reducing the risks
                            associated with this compound. TEMED is vital for the liberation of radicals from APS. In the
                            absence of TEMED, polymerisation at room temperature by solely APS is slow, so at -20°C the
                            polymerisation would be even slower <a href="#sbdref5">(5)</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>Recently, an alternative approach to crosslinking methacrylated dextran polymers into a hydrogel
                            is has been developed, using radiation instead of the APS TEMED system. This approach
                            circumvents the use of toxic crosslinkers. If the methacrylated dextran monomers are pure,
                            the crosslinked hydrogel is devoid of unreacted small molecules and no further purification
                            is necessary. Additionally, if a high enough radiation dose is applied, typically 25 kGy, the
                            gel is sterilized simultaneously allowing immediate seeding. Crosslinking by radiation is
                            therefore a very promising option for dextran hydrogel synthesis on an industrial scale <a href="#sbdref7">(7)</a>.

                        <h4>Hydrogel leakage test</h4>
                        <p>1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy has been used to verify that during storage in
                            demineralized water, no dextran or other starting products leak from the hydrogel. Trace
                            amounts of organic residue were detected but could not be assigned. Besides the solvent peak,
                            there is no overlap between the spectra of DMAP, GMA and that of the storage water as can be
                            seen below.

                        <h3>Waste production</h3>
                        <h4>Hydrogel synthesis</h4>
                        <p>Only aqueous waste is produced during the synthesis of methacrylated dextran and the polymerisation
                            into a hydrogel. Aqueous waste is water with small amounts of organic molecules dissolved in it.
                            In our case these are organic molecules are the solvent DMSO, DMAP, unreacted GMA and methacrylated
                            dextran, NaOH, HCl, synthesis byproducts and byproducts formed during the radical polymerisation
                            (including unreacted methacrylated dextran). None of the waste products can be recycled due to
                            dilution or contamination with other compounds.
                        </p>
                        <p>Especially during dialysis, a large amount of aqueous waste is generated. Approximately 50 liters
                            of aqueous waste is produced for 80 mL of hydrogel. The amount of waste can be drastically reduced
                            by changing using a smaller dialysis volume. We used a dialysis volume of 4 litres to accelerate
                            the dialysis. If a smaller volume would be used and equilibrium between the dialysis bag and the
                            medium is established each time, we expect that we can halve the amount of waste, at the cost of a
                            longer purification duration.
                        </p>
                        <h4>After use</h4>
                        <p>The dextran-GMA hydrogel is biodegradable and is therefore safe to use in ecological environments.
                            The bacteria are equipped with a kill switch which will also kill the bacteria after the patch
                            has served its function and is thrown away. In this fashion waste production is kept at a minimum.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Costs</h3>
                        <p>We are using a dextran hydrogel for our system. Medical-grade dextran is expensive. However, the
                            production of one hydrogel only requires small quantities (100 μg). Therefore, the estimated
                            dextran costs for making one 400 μL hydrogel in patch form is around €0,65. Adding other reagents
                            will bring the total costs to approximately €1,00 for one hydrogel in small scale conditions.
                            These costs can be optimized by upscaling. Modifying the bacteria is a one-time expenditure.
                            Afterwards they can be cultured and re-used for a long period. Culturing the bacteria can be
                            performed on a large scale. Costs of medium are very low. Overall, our living material can be
                            produced very cost-efficiently and upscaling would further reduce cost. Before seeding our
                            hydrogel with bacteria, they can be modified for expression of different proteins. By also
                            culturing these bacteria that express infection-reducing enzymes, patches that fight infections
                            can be created by a very modest increase in costs.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                        <p>Although we use toxic chemicals for the synthesis of the hydrogel, they are removed by extensive
                            dialysis of the methacrylated dextran resulting in a biocompatible end-result. Furthermore, a
                            leakage test showed that no leakage occurs from the gels over a period of two weeks. This means
                            that the chemicals do not yield any risk for users of the bandage. The use of a novel,
                            radiation-based crosslinking method and alternative catalysts could reduce the toxicity of the
                            synthesis and polymerization reactions, which would be beneficial for manufacturers. The gel is
                            biodegradable, and its production is relatively cheap.

                    <div class="explanation disappear" id="patientsafety">
                        <p>To address this issue, we consulted several experts from the field of wound healing, diabetic wounds and burn wounds.
                            The enzymes that will be secreted by our patch need to be safe in human systems. Lysostaphin is one of these enzymes.
                            Lysostaphin efficacy has been extensively tested in murine and rabbit models, confirming its effectiveness against
                            S. aureus causing several types of infections (e.g. nasal, orthopaedic implants, abscess lesions, aortic valve
                            endocarditis) <a href="#sbdref9">(9–11)</a>. In those cases, lysostaphin treatment was reported to be non-toxic <a href="#sbdref11">(11)</a>. Clinical studies must
                            be performed to confirm these statements. Therefore, clinical trials are necessary to show that lysostaphin causes
                            no harm when it enters the body through the wound. Although most bacteriocins have no effect on human cells in low
                            concentrations, less is known about higher concentrations. Besides lysostaphin, our E. coli will produce pyocin, a
                            bacteriocin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Pyocin has been shown to be effective against P. aeruginosa lung
                            infections in mice, with its required dose 100-fold lower than the commonly used antibiotic tobramycin <a href="#sbdref12">(12)</a>. It
                            still needs to be determined whether it is safe in humans, but there is no indication it will be.
                        </p>

                        <p>The hydrogel that we use is biocompatible and has been used in humans before. However, GMA that is necessary for
                            the synthesis is highly toxic and carcinogenic.  Dialyzing the methacrylated dextran product for one week ensures
                            complete removal of GMA. 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy has been used to verify that during storage in
                            demineralized water, no dextran or other starting products leak from the hydrogel . Therefore we know it is safe to
                            use for an application on the skin. The trace amounts of organic material that do leak out could not be assigned to
                            any known reagents or (by)products but it was collected from the 50 mL of storage water. This means that the presence
                            of organic materials in the storage water can be neglected as their concentration is extremely low.
                        </p>
                        <p>The strains of E. coli (BL21(DE3) and BLR) that we use do not present a direct threat to human health, plants or
                            microorganisms, since it is an biological agent of category 1 (13–15). This means that it is very unlikely that they
                            are harmful to humans. Besides the bacteriocins that are secreted, E. coli has been modified to express a number of
                            different proteins. As mentioned above, these proteins are harmless.
                        </p>
                        <p>In conclusion, to make our gel user friendly and safe, we used a hydrogel that is not hazardous and is safe when in
                            contact with living organisms. Our E. coli strain is harmless. However, it must still be confirmed that the used
                            bacteriocins are safe to humans. To this date there is no indication that it the bacteriocins would be any more
                            hazardous than conventional antibiotics.

                            possible hazards are the dextran material, the diffusion of lysostaphin and pyocin and the bacteria that are
                            inside the gel. As we discussed above under patient safety, both of theseboth molecules seem safe to humans.
                            The same applies to the E. coli strain used. Obviously, it remains important to wash hands before and after
                            handling the patch or touching the wound.
                        </p>

                            Moreover, to work healthily and safely, is it also important that the gel can be applied easily. Therefore,
                            it should not require much physical work and should not be harmful for the nurses. It would be beneficial
                            if the plaster looks normal, something that feels familiar to the patient and nurse. It should not give

                            application should be straightforward and easy. This requirement is thus met. Overall, it can be

                    <p><b>Problem: </b>We want to prevent foreign bacteria from invading the gel to avoid them from competing with <em>E. coli</em> for resources.</p>
                    <p><b>Experts: </b>Dr. Sandra Hoffman, iGEM Düsseldorf 2018, PAMM, Dr. Edgar Peters</p>
                    <p><b>Solution: </b>The risk of infiltration is relatively low thanks to the secreted
                        bacteriocins. We may lower the risk by means of a quorum sensing system and the
                        regular replacement of the plaster.

                    <div class="explanation disappear" id="infiltration">
                        <p>Several experts and stakeholders asked us whether the risk exists that foreign bacteria infiltrate <em>Gelcatraz</em>.
                            Infiltration would form a serious safety hazard. What if malignant bacteria colonize the material and use it to secrete
                            toxins to patients? We thus researched this issue and consulted several experts on the topic.
                        </p>
                        <p>In principle, we do not think that the risk of infiltration is high, as ‘our’ <em>E. coli</em> bacteria secrete toxins. This
                            does not make the material an attractive environment for foreign bacteria, or at least the targeted ones. Once we
                            will have incorporated a broad spectrum of toxins to be secreted on demand, the risk of infiltration by malignant
                            bacteria will be minimal.
                        </p>
                        <p>What remains, is the risk of non-targeted bacteria infiltrating the gel. Think of benign bacteria present on our
                            skin, which will be attracted by the nutrient-rich environment of the gel. Although this will not pose a
                            safety-hazard, it would be problematic when they outcompete <em>E. coli</em> and consume the nutrients. It is, however,
                            more likely that <em>E. coli</em> remain the dominant species, as they are present in large amounts.  As foreign bacteria
                            lack the binding affinity for Dextran that our <em>E. coli</em> have, this will only happen when the gel forms a
                            sufficiently attractive environment and when they can live together symbiotically with <em>E. coli</em>. This is not
                            necessarily a bad thing, such as in the case of mutualism or commensalism. Whether this happens, will need
                            to be tested experimentally. In case it happens, we researched some preventive measures.</p>
                        <h3>Changing the plaster</h3>
                        <p>A simple measure may be frequent replacement of the plaster. This would ensure fresh nutrients and fresh <em>E. coli</em> bacteria. A disadvantage of this is inconvenience for the patient, which was highlighted by doctors from the Maasstad Hospital. Clinical studies will need to show the optimal treatment duration and replacement frequency.</p>
                        <h3>Quorum Sensing</h3>
                        <p>Bacteria use quorum sensing to regulate activities on a larger scale. This is mostly intraspecies but the molecule AI-2 (Autoinducer 2) has been suggested to be a universal quorum sensing molecule, allowing inter-species communication. Production of this molecule has been found in a wide range of both gram-positive and gram-negative species, by means of the protein LuxS <a href="#sbdref11">(11)</a>. By implementing a luxS knockout in our own bacteria, combined with an AI-sensing gene we can induce production of bactericides upon invasion of unwanted bacteria into our living material. A similar mechanism has also been attempted by <a href="http://2008.igem.org/Team:NTU-Singapore">NTU-Singapore 2008 iGEM team</a>.</p>
                        <h3>Silver coating</h3>
                        <p>Many metals have antibacterial properties (oligodynamic effect), but silver is the most effective and the least toxic to humans <a href="#sbdref16">(16)</a>. It is commonly used in medical treatments. Silver ion release from silver composites has also been presented as an effect antimicrobial method <a href="#sbdref17">(17)</a>.</p>
                        <p>However, silver has both an effect on <em>S. aureus</em> and <em>E. coli</em>. Gram-negative bacteria such as E.coli suffer more structural damage from silver than Gram-positive bacteria like <em>S. aureus</em> <a href="#sbdref18">(18)</a>.</p>

                    <h2>Overcrowding</h2>
                    <p><b>Problem: </b>We should prevent the material from <em>E. coli</em> overcrowding.</p>
                    <p><b>Experts: </b>iGEM Düsseldorf 2018 (see collaborations page )</p>
                    <p><b>Solution: </b>The risk of overcrowding is low, as <em>E. coli</em> uses most of its resources for protein production. However, we could use a quorum sensing system such as the construct developed by iGEM Düsseldorf 2018.</p>
                    <p><span class="moreinfo" data-target="overcrowding" onclick="showMore(event);">More information</span></p>
                    <div class="explanation disappear" id="overcrowding">
                        <p>During the European meetup in Munich we explained iGEM Düsseldorf how we want to make a living material. They recognized the problem of bacterial overcrowding within our construct. Since our bacteria will keep dividing and cannot escape the hydrogel, at some point bacteria will be over-saturated which can lead to problems in protein expression  or even dead. They offered to help us, and we had a meeting with them over skype. They were making a construct that uses the Lux Quorum sensing. Their construct contained 3 plasmids: Luxl (synthase for AHL), LuxR (molecule where AHL binds and can then bind to promotor) and pLux (promotor to which LuxR +AHL can bind). When the promoter gets activated, a phage lysis gene will be synthesized. In our case they offered to send us the plasmids without the Luxl in the construct, so when we add AHL to the hydrogel medium, cell growth will be inhibited. This is a great solution to keep our bacteria in control, as we want them to stay in steady numbers within our hydrogel, with steady lysostaphin production.

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>The concept of Safe-by-Design helped us to prioritize safety during all stages of the project. Thanks to many interactions with stakeholders, we recognized potential problems early on and found creative solutions. We believe that this resulted in a living material and wound healing bandage which will be safe for scientists, patients, medical professionals and the environment. Extensive (clinical) tests will need to verify this. We want to thank all stakeholders that helped us during the process. Without your help, we could not have considered as many aspects of safety!</p>

                <p>From the beginning, the Human Practices took a central role in shaping our 
                    project. When we started our brainstorm sessions in March, we had no clue which
                    topic we wanted to explore. Yet, we wanted it to be relevant to society.
                    During these first months, we got the opportunity to interact with experts
                    and the public to discuss our ideas. These encounters were of great help in
                    our topic selection. During a visit to the Dutch Institute for Public Health
                    and the Environment (RIVM) and the Rathenau Instituut (Dutch organization for
                    technology assessment), we realized that the lack of a safe platform for
                    working with GMOs outside of controlled environments is a problem on itself
                    that deserves a solution. We were excited to tackle this issue with
                    Gelcatraz, but also wanted to work towards a more concrete application. In
                    the time that followed, we consulted several experts and interacted with the
                    public to get feedback on our proposals. Once we had settled on the wound
                    healing application, we interacted with more stakeholders and experts to
                    shape the design of the wound healing patch. We realize that our project
                    would not have been the same without the Human Practices. In the following
                    section, we share the insights we gained from interactions with stakeholders
                    and experts during the three main stages of the project: finding a project,
                    finding an application  and shaping the design .

It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
